# Diabetes-Prediction
Objective of this project is to predict whether the patient has diabetes or not based on various features like Glucose level, Insulin, Age, BMI and others(i.e diabetes dataset). Perform all the steps from Data gathering to Prediction. During Model evaluation,we compare various machine learning algorithms on the basis of accuracy_score metric and find the best one.
